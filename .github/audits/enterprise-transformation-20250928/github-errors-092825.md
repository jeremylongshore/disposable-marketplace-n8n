   - Ensure consistency across all contributors

**Implementation Commands**:
```bash
# Enhance branch protection (requires admin access)
gh api repos/jeremylongshore/disposable-marketplace-n8n/branches/master/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["CI","Test Suite"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```
