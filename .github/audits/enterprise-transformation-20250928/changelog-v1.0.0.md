## Migration Guide from Pre-1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

#### File Structure Changes
The repository structure has been reorganized for better maintainability:

```bash
# Old structure
./example-resellers.csv    # REMOVED
./test-requests.sh         # REMOVED

# New structure
./tests/                   # NEW: Comprehensive test suite
./tests/fixtures/          # NEW: Test data and samples
./.github/                 # NEW: GitHub templates and workflows
./validate-workflow.sh     # NEW: Professional validation tool
```

#### Migration Steps

1. **Update Local Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Pull latest changes
   git pull origin master

   # Install test dependencies
   cd tests && npm install

   # Run setup script
   ./tests/helpers/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Replace Legacy Testing**
   ```bash
   # Instead of: ./test-requests.sh
   # Use: Complete test suite
   cd tests && npm test

   # Or specific test categories
   npm run test:unit
   npm run test:integration
   npm run test:security
   ```

3. **Update CSV Data References**
   ```bash
   # Instead of: example-resellers.csv
   # Use: Test fixtures with multiple scenarios
   ls tests/fixtures/
   # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ small-resellers.csv
   # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ large-resellers.csv
   # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ international-resellers.csv
   # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ invalid-data.csv
   ```

4. **Validation Workflow**
   ```bash
   # New comprehensive validation
   ./validate-workflow.sh --timing

   # Selective validation for CI
   ./validate-workflow.sh --security-only
   ./validate-workflow.sh --performance-only
   ```
